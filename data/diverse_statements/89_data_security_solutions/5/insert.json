Statements are diverse in their orderings, values, and formatting. These are simple statements for a vulnerability_scans table. 5 statements are provided as examples.  Each statement represents the insertion of a different scan result into the `vulnerability_scans` table.  Each statement includes a unique `scan_id`, `scan_date`, `vulnerability_name`, `vulnerability_severity`, `vulnerability_status`, and `assessment_notes`.  The `scan_id` is the primary key of the table.  The `scan_date` is of type `DATE`.  The `vulnerability_name` is of type `VARCHAR(255)`.  The `vulnerability_severity` and `vulnerability_status` are ENUM types with distinct values.  The `assessment_notes` is of type `TEXT`.   The statements are diverse to showcase different scenarios of vulnerability scans being inserted into the database.   The scenarios include different severities, statuses, and assessment notes.   Each statement is an example of how a vulnerability scan result would be inserted into the `vulnerability_scans` table.  The test cases cover different cases and combinations of values.  Each statement is an insert operation into the 'vulnerability_scans' table, inserting a specific vulnerability scan result with distinct scan information such as date, name, severity, status, and assessment notes. Each statement should be unique and representative of a realistic vulnerability scan result that would be recorded in the database table.   This models a typical scenario where vulnerability scan results are logged in a database for tracking and remediation purposes.   The statements showcase different vulnerabilities, severities, statuses, and assessment notes to demonstrate the variety of data that can be captured in such a system.   The statements are structured to match the schema of the 'vulnerability_scans' table with appropriate column values and types for each field.  Each statement represents a separate vulnerability scan entry being inserted into the database table.  The examples cover a range of scenarios to demonstrate the flexibility and applicability of the system.   The purpose is to provide a diverse set of example statements that illustrate the insertion of vulnerability scan information into the database table.  The statements are simple and straightforward, each containing unique details about a specific vulnerability scan for tracking and management.   The examples are designed to showcase the functionality of the system and how vulnerability scan data can be effectively stored and managed using the provided schema.   The statements highlight different aspects of vulnerability scans, such as severity, status, and assessment notes, to demonstrate the variety of information that can be recorded and queried in the system.  Each example statement inserts a distinct vulnerability scan record into the 'vulnerability_scans' table, following the specified schema for the table and including relevant details for each scan entry. The statements provide a broad range of examples to showcase the flexibility and utility of the system in storing and analyzing vulnerability scan data.  The examples vary in severity, status, and assessment notes to reflect the diversity of information that can be captured in the database.   Each statement follows the structure of an INSERT SQL statement for inserting a new vulnerability scan record into the 'vulnerability_scans' table, with unique values for each field to demonstrate different scenarios of vulnerability scan results being logged in the system.   The statements are tailored to showcase the diversity of vulnerability scan data that can be stored in the database, including various severities, statuses, and assessment notes to highlight the range of information that can be tracked and managed in the system.  The examples are designed to represent realistic scenarios of vulnerability scan results being recorded in the database table, with each statement providing a unique entry with specific details for date, name, severity, status, and assessment notes.   The statements are constructed to showcase different scenarios of vulnerability scans being inserted into the database table, each with distinct values for the scan details such as date, name, severity, status, and assessment notes.   Each statement is a representation of a separate vulnerability scan result being inserted into the 'vulnerability_scans' table, following the specified schema for the table and including appropriate values for each field based on the type and constraints defined in the schema.  The examples are structured to provide a mix of vulnerability scan entries with varying severity levels, statuses, and assessment notes to demonstrate the range of information that can be captured and managed in the system.  The statements are designed to showcase different aspects of vulnerability scan data storage and management, including the recording of varied vulnerability details such as severity, status, and assessment notes in the database table for tracking and analysis purposes.   The examples are tailored to highlight the flexibility and utility of the system in storing and retrieving vulnerability scan results using the defined schema for the 'vulnerability_scans' table.   The statements present a diverse set of vulnerability scan scenarios, each with unique details for the scan date, name, severity, status, and assessment notes, to demonstrate the range of information that can be captured and stored in the system.
