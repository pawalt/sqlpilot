Add NULL values and missing columns. The statements should be in a more varied format. 5 statements should be generated.  The Examples should show different possible ordering of columns, different formats, and usage of NULL values.  The Artifacts table has a foreign key constraint with the Collections and Exhibitions tables. A column that does not have a NOT NULL constraint should have a NULL value.  Finally, SQL Entries where all columns are listed, should also have a corresponding NULL value for the NOT NULL column.  The goal is to demonstrate a good mix of entries that have all possible forms while adhering to the database schema.   I ran out of space in ",
