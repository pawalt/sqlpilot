All statements will be simple. Each one for a different table and each one should be diverse in its orderings, values, and formatting.  Each one should be accepted.  Each one will follow the schema provided to the user. All are different tables. One statement for each table. Simple statements.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') will be used on dates. 'Uses the functions tool.  The tool will generate correct statements.'  The names, dates, and ids in the values can be anything and do not have to match across types of records. All fields in each statement are required.  Handles correct data types in each value field.  Dates are formatted as required in the schema. The other fields match the types in the schema.  The availability value contains whether the appointment is confirmed or pending.  These are example records for each table.  Permissions are text.  Role for 'AccessControls' is text.  Permissions is text.  All access controls are inserted with 'Full access to system'.  role and permissions types are text.  Everyone will be given admin permission.  Dates should be in 'Y-M-D' format.  The dates can be any relevant dates. Each record should be unique.  Each doctor, patient etc. should have defined details.  Each detail can be made-up.putString can be used for easier manipulation.  The ddl is already defined, so we are just inserting data to test the structure on the database.  DDL given covers all required types and fields table.  These will be strings executed as SQL.  No SQL injection is possible. 3 of these will meet the date requirement.  Only example CONSTRAINTS provided are table constraints such as foreign key.  Role will be admin for all users in the 'AccessControls' relationship.pickle  All will show an example of a simple insert statement randomly to test data.  Each one will follow the schema to test the functionality.  Correct data types will be inserted, inserted as strings.  The data in this table is generic and should not be treated as actual data, these are for testing the table creation.  Inserts are for the following: Patients, Doctors, MedicalRecords, Appointments, and AccessControls.  The data can be complete fabrications for the purpose of testing the insertions.  Thes\u2026  The tool will output the correctly formed SQL insertion statement.  runSQL return executed.getFullYear() queries.  in a string.format('%Y-%m-%d')-like manner. The strings have specific formats for each variable type.  The SQL is executed within schema constraints. The attributes of each insert are all related to their primary key.  Each of these represents an insert for different records in the database schema provided. Each insertion should reflect correct type data for columns in the tables.  They will be real dates.  The other string data is freeform for testing.  format() in Python is the basis for these assignments.  In this case the strings have specific format placeholders, ex: %s%f%d,. The dates will be random and diverse for each of the five inserts to generate correct output against a test DB.  randint is used to generate these random integers in the date conversions.  Splitting and concatenation can be used for the string processing needed in these statements.  The SQL statements are not being inserted into the database.  This is only for demonstration to show data manipulations based on the given structure.
